Remote Collab for SublimeText
=============================

Remote Collab is an open-source SublimeText plugin for remote pair programming, allowing multiple developers to work together on the same project in real-time. Both peer-to-peer and client-server architectures are currently under consideration, as well as various networking frameworks. As RemoteCollab is a SublimeText plugin, it will be implemented in Python. We intend to follow an agile waterfall development paradigm, and will validate our project through automated testing and user studies.
