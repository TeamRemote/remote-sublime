Remote Collab for SublimeText 
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TeamRemote/remote-sublime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TeamRemote/remote-sublime)

Remote Collab is an open-source SublimeText plugin for remote pair programming, allowing multiple developers to work together on the same project in real-time. Both peer-to-peer and client-server architectures are currently under consideration, as well as various networking frameworks. As Remote Collab is a SublimeText plugin, it will be implemented in Python and will be distributed through the [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/) package manager. Time permitting, we would like to write Remote Collab plugins for other editors, such as Atom and Vim. We intend to follow an agile waterfall development paradigm, and will validate our project through automated testing and user studies.
